# Calculus for Data Science: A Practical Showcase

This repository serves as a practical guide and showcase of fundamental calculus concepts applied to data science and machine learning. It explores single-variable and multivariable calculus to find and classify critical points of functions, a core technique in optimization algorithms.

## Motivation

Calculus is the mathematical backbone of many machine learning algorithms, especially in optimization. Understanding how to leverage derivatives, gradients, and Hessians is crucial for anyone looking to deepen their knowledge of how algorithms like Gradient Descent work under the hood.

This project aims to:
- Provide a clear, code-first demonstration of calculus concepts.
- Showcase a professional data science project structure.
- Serve as a portfolio piece demonstrating skills in Python, data analysis libraries, and software engineering best practices.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized using a structure inspired by the Cookiecutter Data Science template:

```

├── notebooks/                # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis.
│   ├── 01_optimization_with_derivatives.ipynb
│   └── 02_optimization_with_gradients_and_hessians.ipynb
├── src/                      # Source code for reusable functions and classes.
├── tests/                    # Unit tests for the source code.
├── .gitignore                # Files to be ignored by Git.
├── README.md                 # Project overview and instructions.
└── requirements.txt          # Project dependencies.
```

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/calculus-for-data-science.git
    cd calculus-for-data-science
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    - On Windows:
      ```sh
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```sh
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The core of this project is in the `notebooks/` directory.

1.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:**
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    jupyter lab
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the notebooks directory and open one of the files:**
    - `01_optimization_with_derivatives.ipynb`: Explores function derivation, critical point identification, and optimization for a single-variable function.
    - `02_optimization_with_gradients_and_hessians.ipynb`: Extends the concepts to a two-variable function, covering partial derivatives, gradients, Hessian matrices, and 3D visualization.
